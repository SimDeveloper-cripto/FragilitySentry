            This document is a reference guide for <a class="ulink" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/j-trac/" target="_top">JTrac</a>
            - the generic issue tracking web-application. This document is not only a user-guide
            but can also serve as a reference for developers interested in contributing to JTrac.
        </p><p>
            This documentation has been generated using the DocBook configuration
            used by the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.springframework.org" target="_top">Spring</a> development team.
            This particular simplified DocBook helper package was originally developed by Chris Bauer of the
            <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hibernate.org" target="_top">Hibernate</a> project. Thanks go out to all those who
            perfected this very handy approach.
        </p></div><div class="chapter"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a name="introduction"></a>Chapter&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Introduction</h1></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="introduction-about"></a>1.1.&nbsp;About</h2></div></div></div><p>
                JTrac is a generic issue-tracking web-application that can be easily customized by adding
                custom fields and drop-downs. Features include customizable workflow, field level permissions,
                e-mail integration, file attachments and a detailed history view.
            </p><p>
                JTrac was created after the author felt that he could write a much better alternative to a
                commercial defect tracking tool that he was having to use. Development started in 2004.
                JTrac is ideal for issue tracking or bug-tracking, but it has been designed to be generic
                and you can define custom fields to track almost anything you need.
            </p><p>
                JTrac development used to be hosted at jtrac.dev.java.net, but moved to SourceForge
                in early 2006. The older working version was based on Spring MVC, Spring JDBC and MS Access and is not being
                maintained any more. JTrac 2.0 uses Java 5.0 features and was completely re-written to use
                <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hibernate.org/" target="_top">Hibernate</a> for persistence and the
                <a class="ulink" href="https://www.acegisecurity.org/" target="_top">Acegi Security</a> framework for Spring. The presentation
                layer for version 2.0 was mainly using
                <a class="ulink" href="https://opensource.atlassian.com/confluence/spring/display/WEBFLOW/Home" target="_top">Spring WebFlow</a>
                but as of early 2007 (version 2.1.0 onwards) JTrac
                <a class="ulink" href="https://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2007/03/02/wicket-impressions-moving-from-spring-mvc-webflow/" target="_top">switched to </a>
                using the <a class="ulink" href="https://wicket.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache Wicket</a> framework.
				After being dormant for a long time, JTrac development picked up again in 2021, and a new version 2.2.0 was
				released that moved the Java baseline to Java 8.
            </p><p>
                JTrac is extremely easy to install and the only pre-requisite is a Java 8 (or higher) Runtime Environment.
                You can be up and running in seconds because JTrac comes bundled with a small-footprint web-application
                server called <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_top">Jetty</a> and an embedded database called
                <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hsqldb.org/" target="_top">HSQLDB</a>. Please refer to the
                <a class="link" href="#installation" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Installation">installation</a> section of this documentation for details.
                You can also choose to drop the WAR file into an application server of your choice and start using JTrac right away.

            JTrac has all the features that you would expect from a standard issue-tracking application such as
            support for file-attachments and e-mail integration. JTrac offers powerful customization options,
            especially in the areas of workflow and field-level permissions and compares well to even commercial tools.
        </p><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-easytoinstall"></a>2.1.&nbsp;Easy to Install</h2></div></div></div><p>
                One of the useful features of JTrac is that it is distributed with an embedded web-application server
                (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_top">Jetty</a>) that has a very small footprint.
                If you have Java 8 installed you can be up and running after downloading and extracting JTrac - by
                simply using the provided start and stop scripts. JTrac scans its environment on startup and if a
                configured database is not detected, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hsqldb.org/" target="_top">HSQLDB</a> is used by default.
            </p><p>
                If you already have a web-application server that you wish to use (such as
                <a class="ulink" href="https://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_top">Tomcat</a>), you can just drop in the WAR file
                provided and sign on into the application straight-away.
            </p><p>
                You can refer the <a class="link" href="#installation" title="Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Installation">installation</a> section of this document for
                more details. JTrac uses <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hibernate.org" target="_top">Hibernate</a> and so it can
                use any database <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hibernate.org/80.html" target="_top">supported by Hibernate.</a>
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-customfields"></a>2.2.&nbsp;Custom Fields</h2></div></div></div><p>
                JTrac can be used to effectively track various kinds of things such as Bugs, Action Items and Tasks.
                You can easily add the following types of custom fields to a tracker Project (Space):
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Drop Down List</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Free Text Field</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Date Picker</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>(Decimal) Number</p></li></ul></div><p>
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/custom-fields.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Setting up custom fields for a project</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                There is a limit to how many custom fields of each type that you can configure for a Space.
                These limits have been set after careful consideration and would very rarely fail to suffice.
                They are as follows: Drop Down - 10, Free Text - 5, Numeric - 3, Date/Time - 3.
            </p><p>
                The screenshot below shows how creating a new item would look like for the typical
                project (space) where 'Severity', 'Module', 'Type' and 'Priority' have been defined as custom fields.
            </p><p>

            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-customworkflow"></a>2.3.&nbsp;Custom Workflow</h2></div></div></div><p>
                Each tracker project that you create can have a different workflow. JTrac allows for
                complete customization of the tracker-item lifecycle, right down to the names of
                each intermediate state. It is possible to create very sophisticated workflows and a visual
                "map" of the workflow being edited is displayed below the state-transition toggle-buttons
                to make it easier to manage.
            </p><p>
                The default workflow shown below is ideal if you simply want to track issues with just
                two states - Open and Closed. However, with just a few mouse clicks, you can turn this into
                a complex workflow involving multiple states.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/custom-workflow-before.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Default workflow - before customization</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/custom-workflow-after.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Example of a workflow - after customization</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                You can even configure whether or not changing of values is permitted given the current state
                within the workflow - and that too at a field-level. This flexibility allows for some
                interesting possibilities. For example, assume that you want to maintain a "percentage complete"
                field that can be updated at any time during the life-cycle of an item. The screenshot below
                demonstrates how you can set up a drop down field called "% Complete":
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/percent-complete-field.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Setting up of a drop down custom field called "% Complete"</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                Then when customizing the roles and field-level permissions, all you need to do is specify that
                the "% Complete" field is editable even when the status is "Open".
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/percent-complete-roles.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Making a custom field editable when updating an item (after new item has been created)</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                This results in the "% Complete" field being available for updating whenever anyone views an item
                with a status of "Open". Notice also how the "% Complete" field is added as a column to the "History"
                section so that the complete history of changes to this custom field can be viewed.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/percent-complete-history.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Example of a custom field that can be updated even when status is "Open"</p></div></div><p>
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-history"></a>2.4.&nbsp;Detailed History View</h2></div></div></div><p>
                JTrac provides a very detailed history view that completely captures all comments or status
                changes for an item. The history can be seen when viewing an item as shown above.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-attachments"></a>2.5.&nbsp;Attachments Support</h2></div></div></div><p>
                You can upload file attachments at the time of creating of an item or as many times
                as required after an item has been created.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-customroles"></a>2.6.&nbsp;Custom Roles</h2></div></div></div><p>
                JTrac customization does not stop at workflow - you can also define different roles for each tracker
                project that you set up. This allows for power and flexibility. For example you could enforce that
                a "DEVELOPER" role can only mark "Assigned" items as "Fixed" and that only a "TESTER" role has the
                power to mark a "Fixed" item as "Closed". You can even disallow selected roles from being able to
                create new items. JTrac gives you complete control over the workflow and you can easily tweak it
                to fit your existing process rather than the other way around.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/custom-roles.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Example of workflow where each role has clearly defined responsibilities.</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                In the example above, the roles highlighted in red on the visual "map" of the workflow being edited
                mean that at these points in the workflow - a user with the given role can assign only to other roles.
                So in this case, the TESTER can assign a New item only to a DEVELOPER role and not another TESTER.
                And when an item is in the "Assigned" state, a DEVELOPER can only assign to a TESTER when changing the
                status to "Fixed" or "Rejected".
            </p><p>
                Field-level permissions can be mapped to roles which allows for even more flexibility.
                For example, you can set a project up so that only a "MANAGER" can change the "Severity" level after
                a bug is submitted. JTrac makes it possible for you to define very complex workflows, complete with both
				Status and Role dependent field-level permissions, and you can do all this within a single admin screen.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-search"></a>2.7.&nbsp;Search Custom Fields</h2></div></div></div><p>
                The intuitive search screen (shown below) allows for easy execution of common queries such as
                find all items "logged by" or "assigned to" a user (or users). JTrac allows for filtering even on custom fields.
            </p><p>
                You can navigate back to the search setup screen from the search results screen and have the
                search parameters still active. This is useful when trying to tweak complex queries by trial and error.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/search.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>The search screen - which allows filtering on custom fields</p></div></div><p>
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-dashboard"></a>2.8.&nbsp;Dashboard</h2></div></div></div><p>
                The default view when you log into JTrac is a very handy dashboard view that provides the most
                frequently used statistics at a glance. You can click on any of the numbers to immediately bring up
                the search results view listing the items matched. For example, clicking on the count of items
                "Logged By Me" would immediately display the list of items initiated by the currently logged in user.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/dashboard.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Statistics at a glance and search results available with just one click</p></div></div><p>
            </p><p>
                For each Space, you can also drill-down to a finer level of detail by clicking on the right-arrow
                'expand' icon. This expands the dashboard rows so that you can see a break-up of item counts, not only by
                whether 'logged by me' / 'assigned to me' - but against the custom workflow states defined for
                the Space as well. Again, it is possible to directly navigate to the items by clicking on the dashboard numbers.
            </p><p>

            </p><p>
				The dashboard can also be configured to display a list of links that are relevant to the project,
				or shortcuts to saved searches. (Search result pages contain all search parameters in the URL,
				so it's possible to bookmark a search like "all open or in-progress tickets"). For easy access
				those, but also entirely different links, can be displayed on the dashboard. The links are
				configured under "OPTIONS -&gt; Configure links" as shown below. Links can be set to open in the
				same window/tab, or in a new one.

                In addition to be able to search within a single space (project) JTrac allows for searching across
                all (or a sub set of) projects that a user is mapped to. For example, in the screenshot of the
                dashboard above, there are two projects. The "SEARCH" link at the top of the page (as well as the "search"
                link on the "totals" row) would bring up the search wizard that can search across all (or a subset of)
                the spaces assigned to the currently logged in user.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="features-textsearch"></a>2.10.&nbsp;Full Text Search</h2></div></div></div><p>
                The summary and even the detailed descriptions of items are indexed and can be searched.
                Note that if you are upgrading or migrating databases, you may need to "re-index" which
                is an option available to admin users.

                JTrac is able to export the results of any search (or all items in a Space) as an Excel Sheet.
                The link for this appears at the top right of the search results screen.

            </p><p>
                One the data is in a spreadsheet, it is very easy to analyze data and do things
                like creating pivot-tables and charts. Many users use the 'export to Excel' feature
                to fulfil custom reporting requirements.

                Most users will use only five screens in JTrac: Dashboard, Create, View, Search and Results.
                Navigation has been designed with usability and simplicity in mind. A screenshot of the
                search results screen is shown below.
            </p><p>

                You can establish bi-directional links between items. For example you can mark an item as
                being a "duplicate of" another item. You can easily navigate to related items (and back) when
                viewing any particular item.
            </p><p>
                The option to add related items is available when viewing an item after it is created.
                The navigation is designed so that you have the option to execute a search before selecting an
                item to cross-reference.

                When setting up a Space you can define whether this space can be viewed by users without having to log-in.
				It is also possible to make a space inactive - in which case it will not be shown on the dashboard.
            </p><p>
                </p><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="../images/spaces-guests-active.png" align="middle"><div class="caption"><p>Specify if read-only anonymous access is allowed per-space, and whether a space is active</p></div></div><p>

                All status changes for an item will trigger e-mail notifications by default.
                You can choose to add multiple users into a "notify list" at the time of raising a new item
                or updating the history for an item.
            </p><p>

            </p><p>
                The e-mail content is very nicely formatted HTML and is laid out in the same way as how the screen looks
                within JTrac when viewing an item. Users do not need to get used to a different or possibly
                less pleasing format such as plain-text.

                This page can be accessed from the "OPTIONS" menu. JTrac also can handle an e-mail server that requires

                JTrac has built-in support for authenticating user credentials against an LDAP or Active Directory server.
                Please refer the <a class="link" href="#installation-ldap" title="3.8.&nbsp;Configuring LDAP Authentication">LDAP section</a> of the installation guide for more details.
            </p><p>
                JTrac also has support for integrating with a
                <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/apereo/cas" target="_top">Central Authentication Service</a> (CAS) installation.
                The install guide has more details on

                All you require in order to start using JTrac is Java 8 (or higher). Only a JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
                is required and not the full-blown JDK (Java Development Kit).
            </p><p>
                There is a good chance that Java is already installed on your system and you can verify whether it is ready
                to run JTrac by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

java -version
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                If the system responds with a Java version that is 1.8 or greater, you are ready to download and run JTrac.
            </p><p>
                You can download Java from here: <a class="ulink" href="https://adoptium.net/" target="_top">https://adoptium.net/</a>.

                Once you have Java you can start using JTrac right away because you do not need to configure a web-application
                server or a database. JTrac embeds both of these (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_top">Jetty</a> and
                <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hsqldb.org/" target="_top">HSQLDB</a>) to make it easy for you to evaluate JTrac.

                You can use the "stop.bat" script to stop the application. The "start.int" file configures the Jetty server
				to use port 8888 which you can easily change by editing "start.int" (search for "jetty.http.port=8888").
				You may need to do this if JTrac does not start because another server (like Apache, IIS or Tomcat) is already running on port 8888.
            </p><p>
                Remote users should be able to access JTrac over the network by using the machine name instead of "localhost"
                in the URL shown above. If there is a problem, it could be due to a firewall running on the machine where JTrac
                is installed - and you may have to reconfigure things so that for example "java.exe" is not blocked.

                    If you are not on Windows, you may want to rename the start and stop *.bat files to e.g. *.sh for Linux
                    (*.bat is reported to work for Ubuntu). The commands within the batch files will work unchanged as long as
                    Java has been installed correctly i.e. "java" is in the PATH and it is expecting version 8 or greater.
                    You may need to do things like apply executable permissions to the batch files on Linux, e.g. "chmod +x *.bat".

                    For security reasons, it is best that you change the default "admin" password after installing JTrac,
					especially if you are going to make the application accessible on a public-facing web-site over the internet.
                </p><p>
                    JTrac by default will use a "data" directory that will be automatically created
                    within the root folder "jtrac". The data directory will contain the files needed by HSQLDB
                    (the embedded database) as well as hold uploaded attachments. When using JTrac in production, this is
					the location that you should consider <a class="link" href="#installation-backup" title="3.11.&nbsp;What to Backup">backing-up</a> on a regular basis.
                </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installation-settings"></a>3.3.&nbsp;Settings</h2></div></div></div><p>
                For e-mail notifications to work, an SMTP server needs to be configured in JTrac.
                Users who have the ADMIN role will be able to access the JTrac configuration settings
                screen from a link on the "OPTIONS" screen. Note that you will need to provide values
                for the "mail.from" and the "jtrac.url.base" properties also, for things like the hyperlinks
                within e-mail to work properly. JTrac also supports mail servers that require authentication
                or secure connections using SSL. You can refer the descriptions of the available configuration
                property settings available from the settings screen as shown below.
            </p><p>
                If you have trouble getting e-mail to work, one of the things to watch out for is whether
                there is any firewall blocking the communication between JTrac and the mail server - for example
                you may have a firewall runnning on the machine where JTrac is installed. It is very common
                for mail servers to be configured to prevent mail-relay requests from unknown applications or
                IP addresses so you may need to check with your mail server administrator.
            </p><p>

            </p><p>
                JTrac also can lookup and use a JNDI mail session (javax.mail.Session) if required. If you
                provide a JNDI name, JTrac will ignore the SMTP server details provided.
            </p><p>
			   JTrac also provides other settings for an individual headline (jtrac.header.text) and an
			   individual logo on the right-hand side (jtrac.header.text). If no logo is set the original
			   JTrac logo is shown. Various background colors (jtrac.color.*) and some other options
			   can be set here as well. If the jtrac.edit.item configuration item is set to true, people may
			   edit their own items after creating it; otherwise, no change is possible.
			   Admins are always able to change the original item text.

                JTrac is designed so that you can be up and running by just deploying the WAR file into your
                existing web-application server. Note that you need a servlet 3.1 compliant container.
                For example, if you have <a class="ulink" href="https://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache Tomcat</a> 8.5.x,
                you can either copy the WAR file into the [tomcat.home]/webapps folder or choose to upload
                the WAR file through the Tomcat console.
            </p><p>
                JTrac saves database information and uploaded attachments into a directory on the server.
                This directory is logically called the "jtrac.home". When you do a "quick-install" of JTrac
                by just deploying the WAR file, JTrac creates a ".jtrac" folder in the user home folder and
                uses that location as the home directory. This is great for quickly evaluating JTrac but
                when you actually use JTrac in production you should configure the JTrac home directory as
                a location that can easily be backed-up for example.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installation-custom"></a>3.5.&nbsp;Custom Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>
                To customize the location of "jtrac.home" you have the following three options. On startup, JTrac tries to
                detect the value of "jtrac.home", and checks the following configuration options in the order listed below.
            </p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="installation-custom-initprops"></a>3.5.1.&nbsp;Edit the "jtrac-init.properties" file</h3></div></div></div><p>
                    If you explode (unzip) the WAR file, you can edit the /WEB-INF/classes/jtrac-init.properties file
                    and customize the location of "jtrac.home". Note that you can choose to deploy JTrac as an exploded-war
                    and it is not mandatory that you re-package (zip) the WAR file after editing "jtrac-init.properties".
                </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="installation-custom-servletparams"></a>3.5.2.&nbsp;Set a Servlet context parameter</h3></div></div></div><p>
                    For example you can specify the jtrac.home using the Tomcat administration console or as
                    follows using a &lt;Context&gt; parameter.
                </p><p>

                    If you can easily set a system property called "jtrac.home" within the environment of your
                    application server then you don't need to edit the WAR file. Please look at the contents of "start.bat"
                    to see an example of how the appropriate JVM (Java Virtual Machine) parameters can be set when deploying JTrac.
                    For example, if you are using <a class="ulink" href="https://tomcat.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache Tomcat</a> 5.5.X, you can
                    set an environment variable called JAVA_OPTS before invoking the startup script (startup.bat / startup.sh).
                    Here is an example for Tomcat 5.5.X on Windows:
                </p><p>
                    </p><pre class="programlisting">

set JAVA_OPTS=-Djtrac.home=C:/data/jtrac_home -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
                    </pre><p>
                </p><p>
                    If "jtrac.home" has not been configured in any of the above ways, JTrac will create a folder called
                    ".jtrac" in the user home directory and proceed to use that as "jtrac.home".
                </p></div></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installation-database"></a>3.6.&nbsp;Using a different database such as MySQL</h2></div></div></div><p>
                You can configure the database that JTrac uses by editing the "jtrac.properties" file that JTrac expects
                within the "jtrac.home" folder. Note that if JTrac does not find a "jtrac.properties" file in the expected location,
				JTrac creates a fresh one which is pre-configured for HSQLDB. The default contents of this file are as follows:
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

database.driver=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
database.url=jdbc:hsqldb:file:${jtrac.home}/db/jtrac
database.username=sa
database.password=
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
hibernate.show_sql=false
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                You can edit the values above to match the settings of a database that you wish to use.
                Please refer to your database JDBC driver documentation for the values needed for
                the driver and URL. You can look up the Hibernate dialect corresponding to your database type
                from <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html#configuration-optional-dialects" target="_top">this list</a>.
                When using a custom database such as MySQL, you have to create an empty database before starting JTrac.
                When JTrac starts, it will connect to the configured database and create the schema (database tables) if not already present.
            </p><p>
                If you edit the "jtrac.properties" file, ensure that there are no trailing spaces in the entries shown above
                (especially when cutting and pasting from somewhere). This can save you a lot of frustration!
            </p><p>
                Don't forget to make the database driver available for the web-application. If you are using the bundled
                Jetty web-app server, this is as simple as placing the jar file in the "lib" folder along with the
                jetty jar files. If you are using Tomcat, you can either place the jar file under "shared/lib" or within
                the "/WEB-INF/lib" folder of the "jtrac" (exploded) WAR itself.
            </p><p>
                Given below is a sample jtrac.properties file for MySQL. It assumes that you have created a new database
                called "jtrac". Using the default "root" user is obviously not advisable from a security point of view
                and you should try and have a separate user for the database used by JTrac.
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/jtrac
database.username=root
database.password=
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
hibernate.show_sql=false
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                For MySQL, do not use the "autoReconnect=true" parameter in the MySQL URL, this is
                <a class="ulink" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector/j/en/connector-j-usagenotes-j2ee.html#connector-j-usagenotes-tomcat" target="_top">not recommended</a>
                by the MySQL team. The <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP" target="_top">HikariCP</a>
                connection pool used internally by JTrac is configured to refresh stale database connections.
            </p><p>
                You should also ensure that the database default character-set encoding is set correctly for
                your requirements and UTF-8 is normally recommended. When setting up a fresh JTrac installation
                on a non-default database such as MySQL, it is best that you do a small test by creating an item with
                say Japanese or Chinese text in the summary or description. Verify that special characters
                display correctly when viewing the item. Also check if e-mail notifications look okay as well.
            </p><p>
                If your database default character set is not what is expected you can consider setting it
                explicitly for the database to be used by JTrac. For example if using MySQL, you can create the
                database specifying the character set to be used like this:
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

create database jtrac charset utf8;
                </pre><p>
                And then you can force the encoding used by database connections in the JDBC URL. This is
                how the corresponding line in "jtrac.properties" will look like:
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/jtrac?useEncoding=true&amp;characterEncoding=utf8
                </pre><p>
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installation-jndi-datasource"></a>3.7.&nbsp;Using a JNDI Datasource</h2></div></div></div><p>
                You can provide a JNDI datasource name as an additional property called "database.datasource.jndiname"
                in the "jtrac.properties" file. JTrac will ignore the other database properties in this case.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installation-ldap"></a>3.8.&nbsp;Configuring LDAP Authentication</h2></div></div></div><p>
                A couple of extra entries in "jtrac.properties" are required in order to configure LDAP authentication.
                JTrac will attempt LDAP authentication if an "ldap.url" config entry is present.
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

ldap.url=ldap://myldaphost
ldap.searchBase=DC=foo,DC=bar,DC=org
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                The following additional entry is recommended if you are using Active Directory. This switches on an
                LDAP optimization that is specific to Active Directory.
            </p><p>

                The benefit of LDAP authentication is that users can sign-on to JTrac by using their existing LDAP credentials
                (username and password). At the moment, LDAP support is limited to authentication and not authorization.
                Users still have to be created by an administrator and mapped to the relevant Spaces using the JTrac
                administration screens before they can start using JTrac.

                Note that this approach can reportedly apply to other operating systems. If you have been able to do
                this successfully on Linux or Mac environments, please consider contributing some documentation on this.
            </p><p>
                If you choose to use the bundled <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty//" target="_top">Jetty</a> web-application
                server, you can easily install JTrac as a Windows service so that it can start automatically when
                the host machine is switched on. One of the big advantages of this is that the console window will be invisible
                and will run in the background. You can therefore avoid the possibility of the Jetty server getting
                terminated because somebody decided to close "that pesky DOS Window that gets in the way". Having JTrac
                start automatically without requiring someone to log-in is ideal when you have a server that may be
                restarted occasionally due to power outages or maintenance.
            </p><p>
                JTrac can be configured as a Windows service by using the
                <a class="ulink" href="https://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/" target="_top">Java Service Wrapper</a> project. For convenience,
                the JTrac distribution contains a "wrapper.conf" file in the "etc" folder that is pre-configured for
                the Java Service Wrapper. But first you have to download the Java Service Wrapper distribution separately.
                Note that the Java Service Wrapper project supports other operating systems such as Linux or Mac also.
            </p><p>
                Place some of the files from the Java Service Wrapper distribution into the JTrac folder structure as follows:
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>From the "bin" folder, copy "wrapper.exe" to the "jtrac" root folder</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>From the "lib" folder, copy "wrapper.jar" and "wrapper.dll" into the "jtrac/etc" folder</p></li></ul></div><p>
            </p><p>
                To install JTrac as a windows service, open a command prompt, change to the "jtrac" directory
                (where you extracted the JTrac distribution) and run the following command:
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

wrapper.exe -i etc/wrapper.conf
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                This will install a windows service called "JTrac-Jetty". You can now go to the Windows -
                Control Panel :: Administrative Tools :: Services dialog to start the "JTrac-Jetty" service.
                Note that this service is configured to automatically start when Windows starts, by default.
                To remove the service, you can use the following command:
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

wrapper.exe -r etc/wrapper.conf
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                The "wrapper.conf" file in the "etc" folder can be modified in case you need JTrac to run
                on a different port from the default (80). Look for the "-Djetty.port=80" entry.
                When running as a service under the Java Service Wrapper, you can look at the
                "wrapper.log" file in the "jtrac/logs" folder for troubleshooting.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="installation-backup"></a>3.11.&nbsp;What to Backup</h2></div></div></div><p>
                Although in practice JTrac has been found to be extremely stable in production - to safeguard against
                hardware failures, you should regularly backup the database and stored attachments. If you are using JTrac with
                the embedded HSQLDB database, backing up the contents of "jtrac.home" will be sufficient.
                The HSQLDB data will be stored as files in a directory called "db" under the JTrac home.
            </p><p>
                If you are using the JTrac distribution as-is, i.e. if you are using the bundled Jetty application
                server - the JTrac home directory will be called "data" and this is created automatically under the
                folder where you un-zipped JTrac.
            </p><p>
                Of course, if you are using a different database you will have to backup the database separately.
                The "jtrac.home" would still need to be backed up because this is where uploaded attachments are stored.

                JTrac can be installed in a few minutes without having to type any commands and you don't even need
                to set-up a database. Configuring an e-mail server for notifications is something easily done through
                the user interface. One of the reasons why many people choose JTrac over other open-source
                issue trackers or bug trackers is because of <a class="link" href="#installation-quick" title="3.2.&nbsp;Quick Installation">how easy it is to set up</a>.
            </p><p>
                JTrac is also written from the ground up to make use of the very best and latest in Java. For example
                JTrac is developed using JDK 5.0 features, uses Apache Wicket, Spring and Hibernate and has full
                internationalization support.
            </p><p>
                JTrac is designed to be able to handle requirements management in the future and this an area where there
                is a clear lack of open source tools that support the needs of agile development teams.
                JTrac also has flexible workflow capabilities and offers a rare level of control over field-level
                permissions.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="faq-architecture"></a>4.2.&nbsp;What is the JTrac architecture like?</h2></div></div></div><p>
                The presentation layer is using the <a class="ulink" href="https://wicket.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache Wicket</a> framework.
            </p><p>
                The service layer uses the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.springframework.org" target="_top">Spring Framework</a>.
                Also the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.acegisecurity.org/" target="_top">Acegi Security</a>
                framework for Spring has been used. JTrac is effectively a "light-weight" Java EE application and any
                version 3.1 compliant servlet engine is sufficient for deployment.
            </p><p>
                <a class="ulink" href="https://www.hibernate.org/" target="_top">Hibernate</a> is used for data persistence. This allows for
                JTrac to be database neutral and any database supported by Hibernate can be used.

                There was an earlier version of JTrac which used to be hosted at jtrac.dev.java.net.
                That project was called "jTrac" (with a lowercase 'j') and it was based on Spring JDBC and MS Access.
                JTrac was completely re-written to use Spring and Hibernate - and the 2.0 version number reflects this.

                HSQLDB is surprisingly resilient and we have an instance of JTrac running in the place where
                I work that over a span of 2 years has accumulated more than 2000 items across multiple spaces
                with around 200 users. The database file has grown beyond 10MB but there are still no signs of problems
                and the application screens still load fast.
            </p><p>
                But depending on what you are comfortable with, you can consider moving to another database if your usage
                is really high. The <a class="link" href="#upgrading-migrating" title="7.4.&nbsp;Database Migration">upgrading section</a> of this document
                has details on how you can migrate data from HSQLDB to other databases such as MySQL.

                This is very easy and does not require any Java programming knowledge. You just need to edit
                a couple of HTML files and place any needed resources like images in the right place. Have a
                look at the section on <a class="link" href="#dev-lookandfeel" title="8.8.&nbsp;Customizing look and feel">customizing look and feel</a> in
                the developer guide.

                JTrac provides an ample number of custom fields which can be used for all kinds of tracking needs.
                In very rare cases where people run out of custom fields, it is invariably for "free text" fields.
                The limit on custom fields is primarily for performance reasons especially where filtered searches
                are involved. So when JTrac introduces the feature of being able to "tag" items, these kinds of
                things are likely to be covered.
            </p><p>
                Anyway, if you really, really want more custom fields, the JTrac code is very clean and you can
                easily customize a version that meets your requirements. A few people have reported having
                done this and for example -

                We are just trying to use the SourceForge infrastructure as far as possible and the activity on
                the SourceForge trackers translates into higher rankings which is important for project visibility.
                At this point, we would rather not get into the details of hosting an instance of JTrac on the internet.

            JTrac has one of the most developer-friendly set-ups among open-source projects. It will take you
            only a few minutes to be up and running no matter which Java IDE you use. We actively encourage
            contributions and with your support JTrac can become better than it is today.

                In a future version of JTrac, the ability to even hide fields depending on the role and status
                will be implemented. The design for this is already in place.

                JTrac will support "nested" items under a first-level "parent" item and the design
                and database schema for this is already in place. This will allow users to split tasks into sub-tasks
                and opens up other possibilities. One of the plans in the roadmap is to build JTrac into a full-fledged
                requirements capture tool complete with test-case management and traceability. JTrac can then be used to
                manage user-stories or use-cases for agile development teams.

                Using <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell" target="_top">Beanshell</a>, users should be able to introduce custom routines
                to validate item data entered by a user. Even conditional validation across fields should be possible.

                Again using Beanshell, users should be able to define routines to execute periodically, say at a pre-determined
                time every day. This would allow triggers for events such as slippage of a "due-date" field.
                This can be combined with e-mail notifications. Also a daily dashboard summary could be mailed out once
                the scheduler is in place. [As of version 2.1.0 - the scheduler is already in place for those
                who are working on extending JTrac.]

                JTrac should be able to monitor an e-mail account and incoming e-mail should trigger
                creation / updation of items. It would be handy to have attachments submitted through email also.

                A one-to-many data model for being able to tag items "Web 2.0" style is already in place.
                This would be ideal to track things such as mapping bugs to software release version numbers,

                In the latest version of JTrac, it is possible to import items from an Excel sheet. See this YouTube video for a demo:

                JTrac uses the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.acegisecurity.org/" target="_top">Acegi Security</a>
                framework which supports integration with a
                <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/apereo/cas/" target="_top">Central Authentication Service</a> (CAS) installation.
                You can refer to the <a class="link" href="#installation-cas" title="3.9.&nbsp;Integrating with CAS for Single Sign On">installation guide</a> for how to configure JTrac to use CAS
                for single sign on. As of version 2.1.0 JTrac supports LDAP authentication out of the box. This needs to be
                improved by adding an admin screen that can browse and add users from an LDAP server. Authorization using LDAP
                and allowing users to plug in custom authentication and authorization routines would be good to have as well.

                For the convenience of those who would like to test the latest possible builds of JTrac without
                having to check-out and compile from version-control, binaries in WAR form are periodically uploaded
                to the JTrac web-site at this URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://j-trac.sourceforge.net/files/" target="_top">https://j-trac.sourceforge.net/files/</a>
            </p><p>
                You would be able to see the time-stamp of the last uploaded binary when you access the above URL.
                Subscribers to The JTrac mailing-list would be notified whenever a new binary is available. This
                is not on a daily basis at the moment and happens only when significant changes or fixes are made in

                            Interim builds are provided only as WAR files. If you are using the embedded Jetty
                            webapp-server, you have to replace the WAR that came along with the formal downloadable distribution.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                            When you are replacing the WAR file in an existing installation it is best that you
                            delete the contents of the webapp-server temporary / work folder before re-starting.
                            Details on how to do this are provided in the "<a class="link" href="#upgrading" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Upgrading and Database Migration">upgrading</a>" section of this document.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                            In rare cases, there may be database schema changes. This will be made clear in
                            the upload notification that is broadcast on the mailing-list. If you wish to retain
                            existing data, you will have to run a database upgrade script. Details on how to do this are
                            also provided in the "<a class="link" href="#upgrading" title="Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Upgrading and Database Migration">upgrading</a>" section of this document.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                            Even if the database schema has changed, JTrac will re-create the database if one does
                            not exist on startup. So when trying out the interim builds, this may be all that you really
                            want to do. If you are using JTrac bundled with Jetty and / or with the embedded HSQLB database,
                            removing the old database is as simple as deleting the "db" folder in which HSQLDB keeps
                            the data files. Of course, you don't have to disturb your existing data at all since running a
                            fresh instance of JTrac is as easy as extracting the distribution to a new directory.

            Upgrading to higher versions of JTrac is usually as simple as replacing the WAR file and deleting the web-app
            server temporary / work folder before re-starting. In some rare cases the database schema may have changed and a
            script for updating the database would then be provided. It may also happen that upgrading the Jetty version would be
            recommended in case you happen to be using the bundled Jetty webapp-server for deploying JTrac.

                In case you are using the bundled Jetty server in the JTrac distribution, you should delete the contents
                of the folder called "work". Note that Jetty expects a folder called "work" to exist when it starts,
                so ensure that you leave the empty "work" folder in place.
            </p><p>
                If you are using another application server please follow the steps for removing temporary files
                corresponding to the server that you are using.

                Previously, if the JTrac release notes mentioned database schema changes, you needed to additionally run an upgrade
				script before restarting the webapp-server with the new WAR in place. Upgrade scripts came in the form of
                <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/beanshell/beanshell" target="_top">Beanshell</a> scripts (*.bsh) and would be always
				released within the "etc" folder of the JTrac downloadable distribution.
            </p><p>
				But starting with version 2.2.1, JTrac is configured to update the database automatically, so nothing needs to be done for this.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="upgrading-jetty"></a>7.3.&nbsp;Upgrading Jetty</h2></div></div></div><p>
                If you are using the embedded Jetty web-app server, you can also choose to upgrade the JAR files that
                make up Jetty. This is optional, but is as simple as overwriting the contents of the "lib" directory
                with the corresponding files within the new distribution. You can easily check if the Jetty related JAR
                file versions have changed because the file-names clearly include the version numbers.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="upgrading-migrating"></a>7.4.&nbsp;Database Migration</h2></div></div></div><p>
                Using the Beanshell based approach above, it is relatively straightforward to port data into another
                database. This is useful especially in those cases where you start off using JTrac with the embedded
                HSQLDB database and then decide to scale up and move to something like MySQL.
            </p><p>
                First, you should start the application re-configured to point to the new database and let JTrac
                do the hard work of creating all the database tables. It is not necessary for Jtrac to be shut-down
                before proceeding with the next step,  but don't log-in yet!
            </p><p>
                A Beanshell script called "jtrac-hsqldb-to-mysql.bsh" is available in the "etc" folder of the
                JTrac distribution. You can execute this just like described in the previous section on upgrading.
                Note that you will need to have both the database drivers on the classpath in this case. You should
                of course edit the database connection parameters (for database 1 and database 2) to suit your environment.
                Some more instructions are provided within the script file on how to ensure database encoding and invoke
                the script on the command line. For example, if your database has a lot of data, you should configure
                the Java process to use more memory by passing a command line parameter like "-Xmx512m".
            </p><p>
                This particular script is extremely generic and it should be possible to use this to migrate across
                combinations of databases other than HSQLDB and MySQL. The use of BeanShell means that you can edit
                the script without needing to compile it.
            </p><p>
                Do back-up your data before performing a database migration. You are well advised to perform
                a "dry-run" and test if everything is ok once. Do check if special characters (e.g. Japanese
                / Chinese) can still be viewed correctly when JTrac is using the new database. Also pay attention
                to any errors or warning messages that may appear on the console when the migration script runs.

                The JTrac development environment uses Maven 2 only for dependency management and generating and deploying the JTrac
                website hosted at SourceForge. Almost all other development actions (clean, compile etc) are fired through
                a detailed Ant script that is able to use the dependency information managed by Maven. Using Maven ensures that
                no binaries (JAR files) need to be checked into version control at all.
            </p><p>
                You can get some idea about the details and rationale of the custom Ant + Maven integration approach from
                <a class="ulink" href="https://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2006/04/18/another-way-to-integrate-maven-2-with-ant-and-netbeans/" target="_top">this blog post.</a>
            </p><p>
                But if you are comfortable using Maven, the pom.xml is Maven 2 compliant which means that you can
                <a class="ulink" href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/" target="_top">directly build the war file</a> without Ant.
                You can even choose to use the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-9/index.html#jetty-maven-plugin" target="_top">maven-jetty-plugin</a> by
                uncommenting the section in pom.xml that declares this.
            </p><p>
                Although NetBeans is preferred by the JTrac developers, depending on an "IDE Neutral" Ant script
                ensures that you would easily be able to use Eclipse (or any other IDE of your choice) without any problems.
            </p><p>

                Maven 2 should be in your "PATH". You can test this out by opening a command prompt and trying to run the

                </p><pre class="programlisting">

mvn antprops:generate
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                This step will not only download all the required JAR files (which may take time only for the first time),
                but also generate a standard properties file that will contain all the information required for
                the Ant build script to operate. The file generated is called "build-deps.properties"
            </p><p>
                Note that you need to perform this step every time the "pom.xml" file changes. This happens rarely
                and typically when newer versions of JTrac dependencies (e.g. Spring and Hibernate) are available. Keep
                watching for changes in the versions of JTrac dependencies or specifically changes to "pom.xml" to avoid
                any problems.
            </p><p>
                If the command does not work, maybe you are not connected to the internet. Here's a tip that may help if you
                are behind an HTTP proxy. This has been reported to work even when the proxy requires NTLM authentication.
                You can append a parameter when running Maven commands as follows:
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

mvn antprops:generate -Dhttp.proxyHost=172.19.56.56
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                Note that if your proxy port is different from the default 80, you will have to add an "http.proxyPort"
                parameter as well.

                If you are a NetBeans user you are ready to build and run JTrac!  Just use the "Open Project"
                option from the "File" menu, browse to and select the "jtrac" folder. You should be able to open it
                as a valid NetBeans project.
            </p><p>
                If you want to use Eclipse, that's easy as well. First you have to run the following command and
                Maven will then generate the Eclipse project descriptor files for you.
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

mvn eclipse:eclipse
                </pre><p>
            </p><p>
                That should create the ".project" and the ".classpath" files. Now its just a matter of
                importing "Existing Project into Workspace" within Eclipse. Note that the Eclipse project descriptor
                files also need to be re-generated when JTrac dependencies change, i.e. when "pom.xml" changes.
                Make sure you do this also if you ever run "mvn antprops:generate".
            </p><p>
                For Eclipse to work with Maven 2, you have to have a classpath variable called "M2_REPO" set correctly.
                Refer the <a class="ulink" href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-ide-eclipse.html" target="_top">Maven 2 documentation</a>
                for details on how to do this.
            </p><p>
                While debugging, if you would like to step through the source of dependencies as well, you can tell Maven
                to download sources for dependent jar files. Note that source may not be available for some jars.
            </p><p>
                </p><pre class="programlisting">

mvn eclipse:eclipse -DdownloadSources=true
                </pre><p>
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dev-building"></a>8.7.&nbsp;Building And Running JTrac</h2></div></div></div><p>
                You can explore all the Ant targets that are available. You can also try the "jetty-start"
                Ant target straight away that will compile, create and deploy the exploded war as well as boot a Jetty server.
                For NetBeans users, the "jetty-start" target is conveniently mapped to the "Run Main Project (F6)" shortcut,
                once you make JTrac the "main project". Note that this Ant target is smart enough to detect if Jetty
                is already running and will perform a shutdown if required before re-starting.
            </p><p>
                When starting with freshly checked-out source code, the Ant script may prompt you for a JTrac Version
                and then create a "version.properties" file. This process is just to make the JTrac release process easier
                so it does not really matter what you type. You would typically need to do this only once in development mode.
            </p><p>
                Maven has been configured to download the Jetty web server which drastically reduces the amount of
                setup that you need to do in order to set up your development environment. Since JTrac creates
                the HSQLDB database if required on startup, you do not need to worry about  installing, configuring
                and creating any database either.
            </p><p>
                If you want to use Apache Tomcat instead of Jetty, just have "build.properties" point to a valid Tomcat instance.
                By now, you may have noticed that because of the
                <a class="ulink" href="https://ptrthomas.wordpress.com/2006/03/25/how-to-start-and-stop-tomcat-from-ant/" target="_top">Ant script</a>,
                you don't even need a Tomcat or Jetty plugin in either NetBeans or Eclipse.

                This is very easy and does not require any Java programming knowledge. If you unzip the file called
                "jtrac.war" the HTML files used by JTrac can be found in the folder: "jtrac/WEB-INF/classes/info/jtrac/wicket".
                All you need to do is edit 'BasePage.html' which is the common template used by all web-pages
                in the JTrac user-interface. You may want to also edit 'LoginPage.html' and 'LogoutPage.html' as well.
            </p><p>
                You can place any additional images you need such as a company logo at the top level or in "jtrac/resources"
                where all the other images used by JTrac are kept. JTrac uses a single CSS file  called "jtrac.css"
                which is also in the "resources" folder. You can easily customize the fonts, colors and icons used across
                JTrac by just editing a single CSS file.
            </p></div><div class="sect1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dev-translating"></a>8.9.&nbsp;Adding a language translation for JTrac</h2></div></div></div><p>
                JTrac has full internationalization (i18n) support and you can easily add a new language without re-compiling JTrac.
                All you need to do is introduce a translated version of the existing "messages_en.properties" file into
                the "/WEB-INF/classes" folder. Note that you will need to unzip the WAR file in order to add more files to it.
            </p><p>
                For example, if you need to add a translation into French, a file called "messages_fr.properties" should exist.
                You can refer the list of Java locale codes
                <a class="ulink" href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/locales.html" target="_top">here</a>. Note that country
                specific locales are also supported, for example "fr_CA" means "French, Canada".
            </p><p>
                You can look at the existing translations e.g. "messages_de.properties" as examples. Note that
                JTrac needs to be restarted for changes to the properties files to take effect. However,
                switching the language for any user can easily be done anytime from the "Edit Your Profile" link on the
                options screen and this takes effect the instant the user saves his profile.
            </p><p>
                You can also get the latest versions of the "messages_en.properties" as well as the available
                translations directly from version control at this url:

                Since these may change a lot, it is recommended that you check here as well before submitting
                a translation. We recommend that you submit translations as attachments on the
                <a class="ulink" href="https://sourceforge.net/p/j-trac/patches/" target="_top">JTrac patches tracker</a>
                where we keep track of code contributions as well.
